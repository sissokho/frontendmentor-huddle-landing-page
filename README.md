This is a solution to the [Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks-5ca5f5981e82137ec91a5100). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This was built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. Vite is used for the development environment.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the project.
git clone https://github.com/sissokho/frontendmentor-huddle-landing-page.git

# Navigate to the folder
cd frontendmentor-huddle-landing-page

# Install the dependencies.
npm install

# Run the development server.
npm run dev
```

## Code formatting

To format the code with prettier, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run format
```

However, this process is automated and done before each commit using Git hooks thanks to [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).
